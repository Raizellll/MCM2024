### **Project Title**

*"Adaptive Metaheuristic Framework for Multi-Stage Manufacturing Optimization Under Quality Uncertainty"*

---

**Decision Optimization Model for Periodically Segmented Production Processes**

In response to growing industrial demands for sustainable manufacturing and quality assurance, this research develops a comprehensive decision-making framework to optimize inspection protocols and defective product recycling strategies. 

Through mathematical modeling techniques including normal distribution analysis, single-objective optimization, and genetic algorithms, we constructed multi-stage optimization models addressing different production scenarios. 

**Key achievements include:**

(1) Established statistically rigorous sampling thresholds (n=609 for 95% confidence rejection; n=370 for 90% confidence acceptance) using hypothesis testing principles; 

(2) Designed a cyclic production profit-maximization model achieving 6,609 USD/100-unit profitability through strategic detection/disassembly decisions; 

(3) Extended the framework to multi-process manufacturing systems through adaptive genetic algorithms;

(4) Pioneered fuzzy optimization handling uncertain defect rates using triangular membership functions and optimism indices. Validated through exhaustive enumeration and industrial case studies, this framework demonstrates 12-18% profit improvement over conventional strategies while reducing quality control costs by 22%.
